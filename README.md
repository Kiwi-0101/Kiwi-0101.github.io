## Hi there 👋

Hi,My name is Kiwi, and I am currently studying artificial Intelligence at Tsinghua University.

I am a product and technology developer, and I am very keen on the exploration of AI and web3 fields. I once worked as a product intern in AVAR, participated in the construction of firstlayer2 in LXDAO, and also carried out game development and APP development. Now I am learning large language models and developing related products. I am currently a partner in the paid community.

I like going to the movies, traveling ✈️ and reading 📘.

Let's be passionate!.
