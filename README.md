## Hi there 👋

### 想来看看我的主页吗: https://kiwi-0101.github.io

I'm Kiwi 林湘荀, a senior majoring in electronic Information Engineering at Dalian University of Technology. I have spoken as an undergraduate representative at IWDW academic conferences.

I am a product and technology developer, and I am very keen on the exploration of AI and web3 fields. I once worked as a product intern in AVAR, participated in the construction of firstlayer2 in LXDAO, and also carried out game development and APP development. Now I am learning large language models and developing related products. I am currently a partner in the paid community.

I like going to the movies, traveling ✈️ and reading 📘.

Let's be passionate!.
